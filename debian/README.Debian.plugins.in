collectd plugins on Debian
==========================

Some plugins require additional libraries. To prevent you from having to
install dependencies that you don't actually need those libraries are
recommendations rather than dependencies.

apt-get(8) and aptitude(8) will install recommended packages automatically by
default. If you did not disable this feature you will have everything in place
to operate all plugins. Else you have to install missing dependencies manually
(see the section "Plugin dependencies" below).
