collectd (4.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restrict libcurl4-gnutls-dev build dependency to versions which are not
    affected by #488701 (Closes: #489091).
  * Added linux-libc-dev (<< 2.6.25-1) as an option to the linux-libc-dev
    (>= 2.6.25-4) build dependency - those versions are not affected by
    #479899.
  * Added build dependency on pkg-config - this is used by collectd's
    configure script to check for a couple of libraries.
  * Added libupsclient-config.sh to imitate libupsclient-config which is no
    longer available. libupsclient-config.sh is a simple wrapper around
    pkg-config. This is a workaround until upstream supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Replaced nut-dev build dependency with libupsclient1-dev:
    Reenabled the "nut" plugin on all architectures.

    when loading perl modules that require such symbols).
  * Disable debugging support.
