collectd (4.6.3-1~bpo50+1) lenny-backports; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for lenny-backports.
  * Remaining changes:
    - Build-conflict with iptables-dev to force the use of the shipped libiptc
      (this allows building the iptables plugin on all architectures).

collectd (4.6.3-1~bpo40+1) etch-backports; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for etch-backports.
  * debian/control:
    - Removed dpkg-dev build-dependency - we don't care about Vcs-* and
      Homepage fields in backports.org.
    - Removed optional build-dependencies libcurl4-gnutls-dev, librrd-dev and
      libsnmp-dev - they are not available in Etch and might confuse buildds.
    - Switch back to build-depend on nut-dev - libupsclient1-dev is not
      available in Etch and limit the "nut" plugin to [!alpha !amd64 !hppa
      !ia64 !ppc64 !mips !mipsel].
    - Replaced linux-libc-dev build-dependency with linux-kernel-headers.
    - Build-conflict with iptables-dev to force the use of the shipped libiptc
      (this allows building the iptables plugin on all architectures).
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - Added a work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) by providing
      a fixed version of OpenIPMIpthread.pc in debian/pkgconfig and adding
      that path to PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Removed the version from the
      libopenipmi-dev build dependency - Etch does not include a fixed version
      of openipmi.
    - Removed libdbi0-dev build-dependency and disabled the "dbi" plugin -
      libdbi is not available on Etch.

    - Added new binary packages libcollectdclient0 and libcollectdclient-dev
      for the newly added client library.

  * debian/copyright:
    - Reference GPL-2 in addition to GPL (latest version), since GPL2-only is
      used by some files.

collectd (4.4.2-3~bpo40+1) etch-backports; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for etch-backports.
  * Removed dpkg-dev build-dependency - we don't care about Vcs-* and Homepage
    fields in backports.org.
  * Removed optional build-dependencies libcurl4-gnutls-dev, librrd-dev and
    libsnmp-dev - they are not available in Etch and might confuse buildds.
  * Switch back to build-depend on nut-dev - libupsclient1-dev is not

    - Limit the "nut" plugin to [!alpha !amd64 !hppa !ia64 !ppc64].
  * Replaced linux-libc-dev build-dependency with linux-kernel-headers.
  * Build-conflict with iptables-dev to force the use of the shipped libiptc
    (this allows building the iptables plugin on all architectures).
  * Reenabled and fixed the work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc
    files) and removed the version from the libopenipmi-dev build dependency -
    Etch does not include a fixed version of openipmi.

 -- Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>  Thu, 18 Dec 2008 11:10:56 +0100

 -- Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>  Sat, 06 Dec 2008 16:53:25 +0100

collectd (4.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) introduced
    in 4.4.1-1 and instead build depend on libopenipmi-dev (>= 2.0.14-1~)
    which includes fixed .pc files. This fixes an undefined symbol error when
    loading the ipmi plugin caused by that work around (Closes: #494665).
  * debian/collectd.init.d:
    - The "status" command now exits with 1 if collectd is not running.
    - Do not suppress output when checking the configuration with the -t
      command line option. This will also show errors that don't cause
      collectd to abort, e.g. failure to load plugins (Closes: #499232).
  * debian/control:
    - Added librrd-dev as the preferred option to the librrd2-dev build
      dependency - the latter one is a virtual package since rrdtool 1.3.
  * Added debian/patches/perl_deadlock.dpatch - upstream patch to fix a
    possible deadlock in the perl plugin (Closes: #499179).
  * Added debian/patches/memory_libstatgrab.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix a typo in the libstatgrab code of the memory plugin.

    fix a possible memory leak.
  * Added debian/patches/snmp_memleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to fix a
    possible memory leak in the snmp plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_fdleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix a possible file descriptor leak in the memcached plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_timeout.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix the timeout passed to poll(2).

 -- Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>  Thu, 18 Sep 2008 19:12:54 +0200

collectd (4.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed librrd0-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev from the build-dependencies -
    those package are no longer available since Etch.
  * Removed byacc from the build-dependencies - collectd now requires bison.
  * Removed libupsclient-config.sh - upstream now supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Include collection3 in /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/:
    - Updated README.Debian to point the collection3's README.
    - Added libconfig-general-perl to the suggested packages.
  * README.Debian: Added a note about how to get collectd2html.pl working with
    version 4 of collectd.
  * Added debian/patches/myplugin_strcpy.dpatch - use sstrncpy() instead of
    strcpy() which is poisoned in collectd.h.
  * collectd.overrides: Removed shlib-with-non-pic-code for nut.so - the
    plugin now links against the shared libupsclient.
  * Do not compress any example files, so they may be used directly.

collectd (4.4.1-2~bpo40+1) etch-backports; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for Etch.
  * Removed dpkg-dev build-dependency - we don't care about Vcs-* and Homepage
    fields in backports.org.
  * Removed optional build-dependencies libcurl4-gnutls-dev and libsnmp-dev -
    they are not available in Etch and might confuse buildds.
  * Switch back to build-depend on nut-dev - libupsclient1-dev is not
    available in Etch:
    - Limit the "nut" plugin to [!alpha !amd64 !hppa !ia64 !ppc64].
  * No longer remove version from libvirt-dev build-dependency - a version
    with Xen support is now available on backports.org.
  * Replaced linux-libc-dev build-dependency with linux-kernel-headers.
  * Build-conflict with iptables-dev to force the use of the shipped libiptc.

 -- Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>  Wed, 20 Aug 2008 10:52:14 +0200

collectd (4.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restrict libcurl4-gnutls-dev build dependency to versions which are not
    affected by #488701 (Closes: #489091).
  * Added linux-libc-dev (<< 2.6.25-1) as an option to the linux-libc-dev
    (>= 2.6.25-4) build dependency - those versions are not affected by
    #479899.
  * Added build dependency on pkg-config - this is used by collectd's
    configure script to check for a couple of libraries.
  * Added libupsclient-config.sh to imitate libupsclient-config which is no
    longer available. libupsclient-config.sh is a simple wrapper around
    pkg-config. This is a workaround until upstream supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Replaced nut-dev build dependency with libupsclient1-dev:
    Reenabled the "nut" plugin on all architectures.

 -- Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>  Mon, 07 Jul 2008 20:45:53 +0000

  * New debconf template translations:
    - gl.po, thanks to Jacobo Tarrio (Closes: #482667).
  * Added a work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) by forcing the
    inclusion of the ipmi plugin and manually specifying the dependencies.
  * Updated standards-version to 3.8.0 (no changes).

    when loading perl modules that require such symbols).

collectd (4.0.7-1) experimental; urgency=low
